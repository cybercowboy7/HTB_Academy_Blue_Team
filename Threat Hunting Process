THREAT HUNTING PROCESS:

SETTING THE STAGE:

  - PLanning and preparation
  - Laying out clear targets based on a deep understanding of the threat landscape, business's critical
requirements, and our threat intelligence insights.
  - Ensure environment is equipped for effective threat hunting; proper logging across systems and 
ensuring SIEM, EDR, IDS are correctly set up and tuned.
  - Stay up to date with recent cyber threats and familiarize with threat actor profiles


FORMULATING HYPOTHESES:

  - Make educated predictions that will guide threat hunting
  - Hypotheses can stem from threat intel, industry updates, alerts from tools, etc.


DESIGNING THE HUNT:

  - Develop a hunting strategy to include data sources that need analysis, methodolgies and tools to be used, particular IOCs
or patterns to look for.
  - Create custom scripts or queries and utilize dedicated threat hunting tools


DATA GATHERING AND EXAMINATION:

  - Collect necessary data;
    - log files
    - network traffic captures
    - endpoint logs
  - apply statistical, behavioral or signature based analysis 


EVALUATING FINDINGS AND TESTING HYPOTHESES:

  - Interpret results of analysis
  - Identify affected systems
  - Determine potential impact of the threat


MITIGATING THREATS:

  - Implement remedial actions;
    - isolate affected systems
    - employ endpoint protection tools


AFTER THE HUNT:

  - Document and share the findings, methods and outcomes
    - updating threat intelligence platforms
    - enhancing detection rules 
    - refining incident response playbooks
    - improving security policies


CONTINUOUS LEARNING AND ENHANCEMENT:

  - Each threat hunting cycle should feed into the next
    - allows for continuous improvement of hypotheses, methodologies, and tools
