Cyber Kill Chain: Consists of 7 stages that are non-linear and are conducted in different ways by each attacker

1. Recon
  - Passive or active information gathering and choosing their targets.
2. Weaponize
  - Create malware payload based on target's type of anti-virus and detection systems and establish remote connection for persistence through reboots etc.
3. Deliver
  - Deliveres the payload via phishing email, social engineering phone call or other means.
4. Exploit
  - Payload is triggered and access/control is maintained by the attacker
5. Installation
  - Droppers can drop malware through email attachments, social engineering, or malicious websites
  - Backdoors give attackers ongoing access to the compromised machine. Can be installed during exploitation or through droppers
  - Rootkits obscure themselves from anti-virus systems 
6. Command and Control
  - Setup remote connections back to the bad actor. 
  - Ensures that the machine can be connected to via multiple avenues of different malware on the compromised machinein case one is found out
7. Actions on objectives
  - Purpose of the attack
  - Exfiltration of data
  - Ransomware deployed at the highest security level
