System Monitor (Sysmon):
- Device driver that remains resident across system reboots to monitor and log system activity to the Windows 
event log. 
- Provides detailed information about process creation, network connections, changes to file creation time, and more.
- Perfect for going beyond the windows event logs and doing a deeper system monitor

Sysmon Primary Components:
- A Windows service for monitoring system activity.
- A device driver that assists in capturing the system activity data.
- An event log to display captured activity data.
