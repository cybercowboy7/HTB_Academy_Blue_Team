- Acive, human-led, and often hypothesis-driven practive that systematically combs through network data to identify stealthy, advanced threats
that evade existing security solutions. This is a PRO-active approach to security versus a REACTIVE approach

- Reduces dwell time of a security breach by detecing malicious activity in the earliest stages of the cyber kill chain

THREAT HUNTING PROCESS:

- Identification of assets (systems or data) that could be high-value targets for threat actors.

KEY facets of threat hunting:
- An offensive, proactive strategy that prioritizes threat anticipation over reaction, based on hypotheses, attacker TTPs, and intelligence.

- An offensive, reactive response that searches across the network for artifacts related to a verified incident, based on evidence and intelligence.

- A solid, practical comprehension of threat landscape, cyber threats, adversarial TTPs, and the cyber kill chain.

- Cognitive empathy with the attacker, fostering an understanding of the adversarial mindset.

- A profound knowledge of the organization's IT environment, network topology, digital assets, and normal activity.

- Utilization of high-fidelity data and tactical analytics, and leveraging advanced threat hunting tools and platforms.

INCIDENT HANDLING IN TANDEM WITH THREAT HUNTING:  Whether these processes should be integrated or function independently is a strategic decision, contingent upon each organization's unique threat landscape, risk, etc.

- PREPARATION PHASE: threat hunting team must set up robust, clear rules of engagement. Operational protocols must be established, 
outlining when and how to intervene, the course of action in specific scenarios, and so forth.

- DETECTION & ANALYSIS: They can augment investigations, ascertain whether the observed indicators of compromise (IoCs) truly signify an incident, and further, 
their adversarial mindset can help uncover additional artifacts or IoCs that might have been missed initially.

- CONTAINMENT, ERADICATION, AND RECOVERY: The specific roles and responsibilities of the hunting team will be stipulated in the procedural documents and security policies.

- POST-INCIDENT ACTIVITY: They can proffer recommendations to fortify the organization's overall security posture.


WHEN SHOULD THREAT HUNTING TAKE PLACE:

- When New Information on an Adversary or Vulnerability Comes to Light

- When Multiple Network Anomalies are Detected

- During an Incident Response Activity

- Periodic Proactive Actions
