- Acive, human-led, and often hypothesis-driven practive that systematically combs through network data to identify stealthy, advanced threats
that evade existing security solutions. This is a PRO-active approach to security versus a REACTIVE approach

- Reduces dwell time of a security breach by detecing malicious activity in the earliest stages of the cyber kill chain

THREAT HUNTING PROCESS:

- Identification of assets (systems or data) that could be high-value targets for threat actors.

KEY facets of threat hunting:
- An offensive, proactive strategy that prioritizes threat anticipation over reaction, based on hypotheses, attacker TTPs, and intelligence.

- An offensive, reactive response that searches across the network for artifacts related to a verified incident, based on evidence and intelligence.

- A solid, practical comprehension of threat landscape, cyber threats, adversarial TTPs, and the cyber kill chain.

- Cognitive empathy with the attacker, fostering an understanding of the adversarial mindset.

- A profound knowledge of the organization's IT environment, network topology, digital assets, and normal activity.

- Utilization of high-fidelity data and tactical analytics, and leveraging advanced threat hunting tools and platforms.

INCIDENT HANDLING IN TANDEM WITH THREAT HUNTING:  Whether these processes should be integrated or function independently is a strategic decision, contingent upon each organization's unique threat landscape, risk, etc.

- PREPARATION PHASE: threat hunting team must set up robust, clear rules of engagement. Operational protocols must be established, 
outlining when and how to intervene, the course of action in specific scenarios, and so forth.

- DETECTION & ANALYSIS: They can augment investigations, ascertain whether the observed indicators of compromise (IoCs) truly signify an incident, and further, 
their adversarial mindset can help uncover additional artifacts or IoCs that might have been missed initially.

- CONTAINMENT, ERADICATION, AND RECOVERY: The specific roles and responsibilities of the hunting team will be stipulated in the procedural documents and security policies.

- POST-INCIDENT ACTIVITY: They can proffer recommendations to fortify the organization's overall security posture.


WHEN SHOULD THREAT HUNTING TAKE PLACE:

- When New Information on an Adversary or Vulnerability Comes to Light

- When Multiple Network Anomalies are Detected

- During an Incident Response Activity

- Periodic Proactive Actions


RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN RISK ASSESSMENT AND THREAT HUNTING:

- Prioritizing Hunting Efforts: By recognizing the most critical assets (often referred to as 'crown jewels') and their associated risks, we can prioritize our threat hunting efforts on these areas. Assets could include sensitive 
data repositories, mission-critical applications, or key network infrastructure.

- Understanding Threat Landscape: The threat identification step of the risk assessment allows us to understand the threat landscape better, including the Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) used by potential threat actors

- Highlighting Vulnerabilities: Risk assessment helps to highlight vulnerabilities in our systems, applications, and processes. Knowing these weaknesses enables us to look for exploitation indicators in these areas. For instance, if we 
know a particular application has a vulnerability that allows for privilege escalation, we can look for anomalies in user privilege levels.

- Informing the Use of Threat Intelligence: Threat intelligence is often used in threat hunting to identify patterns of malicious behavior. Risk assessment helps inform the application of threat intelligence by identifying the most likely 
threat actors and their preferred methods of attack.

- Refining Incident Response Plans: Risk assessment also plays a critical role in refining Incident Response (IR) plans. Understanding the likely risks helps us anticipate and plan for potential breaches, ensuring a swift and effective response.

- Enhancing Cybersecurity Controls: Lastly, the risk mitigation strategies derived from risk assessment can directly feed into enhancing existing cybersecurity controls and defenses, further strengthening the organizationâ€™s security posture.
