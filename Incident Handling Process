1. Preparation
  PART ONE:
    - Skilled incident hadnling team
    - Trained workforce
    - Clear Policies and Documentation
      - Contact information and roles of team members
      - Contacts for legal/compliance team, management, IT support, public affairs, law enforcement, ISP, facilities management
external incident response team
      - Incident response policy, plan and procedures
      - Incident information sharing policy and procedures
      - Baselines of systems and networks, out of a golden image and a clean state environment
      - Network diagrams
      - Organization-wide asset management databse
      - User accounts with excessive privileges that can be used on-demand by the team when necessary. Can be enabled when
an incident is confirmed during the initial investigation and disabled once it is over. A mandatory password reset is also 
performed when disabling the users.
      - Ability to acquire hardware, software, or an external resource without complete procurement process (urgent purchase amount).
      - Forensic/Investigative cheat sheets
      - Establish effective reporting capabilities for notes etc.
    - Tools (Software & Hardware)
      - Additional laptop for forensic workstation for preserving disk images, log files, perform data analysis
      - Digital forensic image acquisition and analysis tools
      - Memory capture and analysis tools
      - Live response capture and analysis
      - Log analysis tools
      - Network capture and analysis tools
      - Network cables and switches
      - Write blockers
      - Hard drives for forensic imaging
      - Power cables
      - Screwdrivers, tweezersm and other relevant tools to repair or disassemble hardware
      - Indicator of Compromise Creator and the ability to search for IOCs across the organization
      - Chain of custody forms
      - Encryption software
      - Ticket tracking system
      - Secure facility for storage and investigation
      - Incident handling system independent of your organization's infrastructure
  PART TWO:
    - DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance)
      - Email protection against phishing built on top of SPF (Sender Policy Framework) and DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail)
      - Idea is to prevent spoofed mail pretending to be from your organization
    - Endpoint Hardening and Endpoint Detection and Response
      - There are standards set by CIS and Microsoft Baselines that are good for modeling comapany baselines off of
      - Disable LLMNR/NetBIOS
      - Implement LAPS and remove admin privileges from regular users
      - Disable or configure PowerShell in "ConstrainedLanguage" mode
      - Enable Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) rules if using Microsoft Defender
      - Enable whitelisting. Block script types such as .hta, .vbs, .cmd, .bat, .js. Look for LOLBin files since they are used
to bypass whitelisting.
      - Deploy an EDR product. 
    - Network Protection
      - Network segmentation. Business critical systems should be isolated and connection allowed only as business requires
      - IDS/IPS systems. Good for SSL/TLS interception so malicious traffic is found out versus just spotting malicious IP addresses
      - 802.1x reduces risk of BYOD connecting to network. 
    - Privilege Identity Management/MFA/Passwords
      - Utilize pass phrases instead of passwords since they are more secure
    - Vulnerability Scanning
      - Self-explanatory
    - User Awareness Training
      - Train users to recognize suspicious behavior and report it
      - Utilize periodic surprise testing like phishing campaigns
    - Active Directory Security Assessment
    - Purple Team Excercises
      - Blue and red teams working together to find and fix vulnerabilities
2. Detection & Analysis
3. Containment, Eradication, and Recovery
4. Post-Incident Activity

Incident Handling Two Main Activities: Investigating and Recovery
- Discover initial victim machine and develop an incident timeline
- Determine tools and malware used
- Document compromised systems and the adversaries actions
