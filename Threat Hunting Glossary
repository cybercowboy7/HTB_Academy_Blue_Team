TERMINOLOGY/CONCEPTS

- INDICATOR: 
  - Encompasses both technical data and contextual information.
  - Isolated technical data lacking relevant context holds limited or negligible value for network defenders
  - Contextual details give indicators significance, enabling effecitve threat analysis and response
  - DATA + CONTEXT = INDICATOR

- THREAT:
  - Intent: Underlying rationale driving adversaries to target and exploit your network infrastructure
  - Capability: Tools, resources, and financial backing that adversaries posses to carry out their operations successfully. Also includes their skills
  - Opportunity: Conditions or events that provide favorable circumstanves for adversaries to execute their operations. Includes instances where
adversaries acquire email, or credentials from your network as well as their awareness of vulnerabilities within specific software systems

- Pyramid of Pain: Visualization of a hierarchy of indicators that support detecting adversaries
  -  https://detect-respond.blogspot.com/2013/03/the-pyramid-of-pain.html
  - Focuses SOC teams to be more proactive rather than reactive
  - Shows us which indicators are going to give the adversary the most problems if we shut it down and detect it
