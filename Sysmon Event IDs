    Sysmon Event ID 1 - Process Creation: Useful for hunts targeting abnormal parent-child process hierarchies, as illustrated in the first lesson with Process Hacker. It's an event we can use later.
    Sysmon Event ID 2 - A process changed a file creation time: Helpful in spotting "time stomp" attacks, where attackers alter file creation times. Bear in mind, not all such actions signal malicious intent.
    Sysmon Event ID 3 - Network connection: A source of abundant noise since machines are perpetually establishing network connections. We may uncover anomalies, but let's consider other quieter areas first.
    Sysmon Event ID 4 - Sysmon service state changed: Could be a useful hunt if attackers attempt to stop Sysmon, though the majority of these events are likely benign and informational, considering Sysmon's frequent legitimate starts and stops.
    Sysmon Event ID 5 - Process terminated: This might aid us in detecting when attackers kill key processes or use sacrificial ones. For instance, Cobalt Strike often spawns temporary processes like werfault, the termination of which would be logged here, as well as the creation in ID 1.
    Sysmon Event ID 6 - Driver loaded: A potential flag for BYOD (bring your own driver) attacks, though this is less common. Before diving deep into this, let's weed out more conspicuous threats first.
    Sysmon Event ID 7 - Image loaded: Allows us to track dll loads, which is handy in detecting DLL hijacks.
    Sysmon Event ID 8 - CreateRemoteThread: Potentially aids in identifying injected threads. While remote threads can be created legitimately, if an attacker misuses this API, we can potentially trace their rogue process and what they injected into.
    Sysmon Event ID 10 - ProcessAccess: Useful for spotting remote code injection and memory dumping, as it records when handles on processes are made.
    Sysmon Event ID 11 - FileCreate: With many files being created frequently due to updates, downloads, etc., it might be challenging to aim our hunt directly here. However, these events can be beneficial in correlating or identifying a file's origins later.
    Sysmon Event ID 12 - RegistryEvent (Object create and delete) & Sysmon Event ID 13 - RegistryEvent (Value Set): While numerous events take place here, many registry events can be malicious, and with a good idea of what to look for, hunting here can be fruitful.
    Sysmon Event ID 15 - FileCreateStreamHash: Relates to file streams and the "Mark of the Web" pertaining to external downloads, but we'll leave this aside for now.
    Sysmon Event ID 16 - Sysmon config state changed: Logs alterations in Sysmon configuration, useful for spotting tampering.
    Sysmon Event ID 17 - Pipe created & Sysmon Event ID 18 - Pipe connected: Record pipe creations and connections. They can help observe malware's interprocess communication attempts, usage of PsExec, and SMB lateral movement.
    Sysmon Event ID 22 - DNSEvent: Tracks DNS queries, which can be beneficial for monitoring beacon resolutions and DNS beacons.
    Sysmon Event ID 23 - FileDelete: Monitors file deletions, which can provide insights into whether a threat actor cleaned up their malware, deleted crucial files, or possibly attempted a ransomware attack.
    Sysmon Event ID 25 - ProcessTampering (Process image change): Alerts on behaviors such as process herpadering, acting as a mini AV alert filter.
