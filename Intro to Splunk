Splunk Enterprise architecture:

- Forwarders: Forwarders are responsible for data collection. They gather machine 
  data from various sources and forward it to the indexers. The types of forwarders 
  used in Splunk are: 
    
    Universal Forwarder (UF): This is a lightweight agent that collects data and forwards 
    it to the Splunk indexers without any preprocessing. Universal Forwarders are individual 
    software packages that can be easily installed on remote sources without significantly affecting 
    network or host performance.

    Heavy Forwarder (HF): This agent serves the purpose of collecting data from remote sources, 
    especially for intensive data aggregation assignments involving sources like firewalls or data 
    routing/filtering points. According to Splexicon, heavy forwarders stand out from other types of 
    forwarders as they parse data before forwarding, allowing them to route data based on specific 
    criteria such as event source or type. They can also index data locally while simultaneously forwarding 
    it to another indexer. Typically, Heavy Forwarders are deployed as dedicated "data collection nodes" 
    for API/scripted data access, and they exclusively support Splunk Enterprise.
    Please note that there are HTTP Event Collectors (HECs) available for directly collecting data from 
    applications in a scalable manner. HECs operate by using token-based JSON or raw API methods. In this 
    process, data is sent directly to the Indexer level for further processing.

- Indexers: The indexers receive data from the forwarders, organize it, and store it in indexes. While indexing 
  data, the indexers generate sets of directories categorized by age, wherein each directory hold compressed raw 
  data and corresponding indexes that point to the raw data. They also process search queries from users and 
  return results.

- Search Heads: Search heads coordinate search jobs, dispatching them to the indexers and merging the results. 
  They also provide an interface for users to interact with Splunk. On Search Heads, Knowledge Objects can be 
  crafted to extract supplementary fields and manipulate data without modifying the original index data. It is 
  important to mention that Search Heads also offer various tools to enrich the search experience, including 
  reports, dashboards, and visualizations.

- Deployment Server: It manages the configuration for forwarders, distributing apps and updates.

- Cluster Master: The cluster master coordinates the activities of indexers in a clustered environment, ensuring 
  data replication and search affinity.

- License Master: It manages the licensing details of the Splunk platform.




Splunk's key components:

- Splunk Web Interface: This is the graphical interface through which users can interact with Splunk, carrying out 
  tasks like searching, creating alerts, dashboards, and reports.

- Search Processing Language (SPL): The query language for Splunk, allowing users to search, filter, and manipulate 
  the indexed data.

- Knowledge Objects: These include fields, tags, event types, lookups, macros, data models, and alerts that enhance 
  the data in Splunk, making it easier to search and analyze.
