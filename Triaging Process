1. Initial Alert Review
  - Review initial alert: Timestamp, source/destination IP, affected systems, triggering rule/signature
  - Analyze logs to gain context of the alert

2. Alert Classification
  - Classify based on severity, impact, and urgency utilizing org's classification system

3. Alert Correlation
  - Cross-reference with related alerts, events or incidents to identify patterns, similarities, or IOCs
  - Query the SIEM to gather relevant log data
  - Leverage threat intel to check for known attack patterns or malware signatures

4. Enrichment of Alert Data
  - Gather additional information to gain context:
    - Network packets, memory dumps, file samples
    - Conduct recon of affected systems for anomalies i.e network connections, processes, file modifications etc.

5. Risk Assessment
  - Evaluate potential risk and impact to critical assets, data or infrastructure

6. Contextual Analysis
  - Evaluate security controls in place
  - Assess the relevant compliance requirements, industry regulations, contractual obligations etc.

7. Incident Response Planning
  - Initiate an incident response plan if the alert is significant

8. Consultation with IT Operations
  - Assess the need for additional context or missing information by consulting with IT operations or relevant departments

9. Response Execution
  - Based on the alert review, risk assessment, and consultation, determine the appropriate response actions
  - If additional context resolves the alert or identifies it as a non-malicious event, take necessary actions without escalation
  - If the alert still indicates potential security concerns or requires further investigation, proceed with the incident response actions

10. Escalation
  - Identifiy triggers for escalation based on org's policies and alert severity:
    - Triggers may include compromise of critical systems/assets, ongoing attacks, unfamiliar/sophisticated techniques, widespread
impact, or insider threats
  - Assess the alert against escalation triggers, considering potential consequences if not escalated
  - Follow internal escalation process
  - Provide comprehensive alert summary
  - Document all communication related to escalation
  - Case dependant, escalate to external entities

11. Continuous Monitoring
  - Continuosly monitor the situtation and incident response progress
  - Maintain open communication with escalated teams

12. De-escalation
  - Evaluate the need for de-escalation as the incident response progress and the situation is under control
  - De-escalate when the risk is mitigated, incident is contained, and further escalation is unnecessary
